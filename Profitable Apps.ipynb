Using build-in function `ord()`, we able to obtain the corresponding number for each character. And according to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), characters used in English text correspond to number in range **between 0 to 127**. Therefore, we should check for app name on our datasets and if we find character number beyond the range of 0 to 127, then most likely that app is not in English languange.\n",
